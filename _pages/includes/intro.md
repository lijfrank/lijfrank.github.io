My name is Jiang Li (李江), and I received the doctoral degree in Intelligence Science and Technology (IST) from <a href="http://english.hust.edu.cn" class="no-underline">Huazhong University of Science and Technology</a> (HUST). During my doctoral studies, I was affiliated with the team led by Prof. Zhigang Zeng (IEEE Fellow) and was supervised by Prof. Xiaoping Wang (IEEE Senior Member). My research interests encompass <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/affective-computing/overview" class="no-underline">affective computing</a> (AC), multimodal learning (MML), graph machine learning (GML), and computational biology (CB). If you are seeking any form of academic cooperation, please feel free to email me at <a class="no-underline">lijfrank AT outlook.com</a>.

I earned the bachelor's degree in software engineering in July 2018 and the master's degree in computer technology in June 2021. Thereafter, I advanced my studies by pursuing a doctoral degree in intelligent science and technology, which I successfully completed in September 2025. I harbor great enthusiasm for scientific research in the field of artificial intelligence and have thus far contributed over 10 papers <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NesqTz8AAAAJ"><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FLijfrank%2Flijfrank.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=Citations"></a> to academic journals or conferences.
